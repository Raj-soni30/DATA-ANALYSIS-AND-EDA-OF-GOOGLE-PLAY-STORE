# DATA-ANALYSIS-AND-EDA-OF-GOOGLE-PLAY-STORE

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Google Play Store data, focusing on key factors influencing app downloads and user engagement. The dataset comprises various attributes such as app names, categories, ratings, reviews, sizes, and more. With 9660 unique apps, the analysis revealed that 89.11% of the apps are unique, and there are no null values in the app column. The dataset includes 34 unique categories, with the top categories being CATEGORY, GAME, and TOOLS, although one erroneous category labeled '1.9' was identified.

The rating column contains 1474 null values, accounting for 13.6% of the dataset. The highest rating observed is 4.4, with 1109 counts and 897 apps achieving this rating. The mean rating is 4.19, and the median is 4.3, though an outlier with a rating of 19 was found. Reviews ranged up to 9992, with an outlier of '3.0M' and some inconsistencies in data types. The type column indicates that 92.6% of apps are free, while 7.4% are paid. In terms of content rating, 80.4% of the apps are rated for Everyone, followed by 11.1% for Teens, 4.6% for Mature 17+, 3.8% for Everyone 10+, and 0.1% for Adults.

The analysis concludes that higher ratings and better reviews correlate with more downloads, and free apps are generally preferred. Apps rated for Everyone, Teens, and Everyone 10+ have a higher download potential, and smaller apps tend to be downloaded more. This project offers valuable insights for optimizing app performance and user engagement on the Google Play Store.
